The paperbot.ino source files have barely been modified. The new source code files: KalmanFilter.py, which implements the Kalman Filter algorithm. We have also implemented a new communication feature that allows us to download .csv files wirelessly - included in the "BytesZaDusto.ino" (comm.cpp & comm.h).
